        Vegetarianism and veganism are undoubtedly among the most discussed topics for the last decades. You probably got a bunch of different opinions on them from the Internet, TV, newspapers, your friends, and maybe even from a small talk to a random person in a line for a coffee on one Monday morning. But who are all of these people talking about vegetarianism and veganism? What unites and separates them? How have these opinions and views been changing with time? People become vegetarians and vegans for different reasons, most ethical, environmental, health, and religious. How do these reasons affect people's opinions? We tried to answer these and some other questions and made this webpage which, we hope, you will enjoy.
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        This text started with a quotation. Quotation (to be a little bit more precise, 66584 quotes) is exactly what we used in our investigation. But don't worry we didn't spend all of our time talking to strangers to gather this enormous set of quotes. We took them from a Quotabank, an open dataset of 178 million quotations extracted from 162 million English news articles published between 2008 and 2020. Then we filtered the data and used some solid data analytics tools like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and regression to get a deeper insight into vegetarianism and veganism evolution.

        The first thing we want to explore is the evolution of media coverage of vegetarianism. Without using numbers, our intuition suggests that this movement is becoming more and more talked about. Indeed, we have all witnessed the appearance of a new brand for a plant-based burger, or videos denouncing animal abuse. The following graph confirms this intuition. The data tells us that media coverage of this movement has grown to achieve a peak in 2018. It is necessary to indicate that the data from 2020 are not complete.
      </p>
    </div>

    

    <div>
      <p class="text-justify">
        A question naturally follows from this observation. How do people feel about this movement? And how has this feeling evolved? We can observe that the general feeling about vegetarianism is rather positive.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="text-justify">
        It is necessary to remember that this analysis concerns quotations taken from the media. In the rest of this story, this result will be deconstructed to try to discover what is hidden under this general impression. Does the sentiment towards the movement depend on a group of individuals?

    <p class="text-justify">The gender of our speakers is dominated by male and female. Overall female speakers tend to have a more positive view about the movement.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">The profession is also an aspect that can influence the feeling towards vegetarianism. In our dataset, the most common profession is politician. This is not very surprising given the strong link this category has with the media. Another profession that is highly represented in our dataset is actor. In the following graph, we can observe that actors (for movies or television) have a more positive feeling about vegetarianism than politicians.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">This probably resonates with most people since actors are often seen as movement starters. Indeed, it is common to see that an actor supports a cause or follows a special diet to be in good shape. This could explain the high score compared to politicians.</p>

USA is the most represented nationality in our dataset. USA and Canada have a positive view toward the movement.

        When we think about vegetarianism, we first view it as a specific diet. But actually, these movements concern more aspects of our life. This set of quotations helps us to identify which other topics can be related to vegetarianism and veganism and gives us a  better understanding of why people speak about these movements.

        Vegetarianism is deeply related to many other concerns our society tackles with: environment and ethics are discussed in more than 40% of all quotations and health in around a quarter of them. It’s talked about as a diet itself that much, because speakers are more likely to argue in favor of veganism using relevant fields people are interested in.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Still, the discussed topics evolve through time, even in the very latest years.
      </p>
    </div>
      
    <div>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Health was the main concern in 2015 and went down since then.
        But discussions about ethics (including animal rights) have become the most popular, even if it wasn’t referenced that muched five years ago.
        More surprisingly, environmental issues are not as widely tackled as we could expect. It’s not increasing, even decreasing a little bit in comparison with other topics.
      </p>

        Such a trend is also confirmed when analyzing the most cited organization, PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) being at the top with three times more occurences than the second one.

    </div>
      
    <div>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Emotion analysis also goes along with these results, like “healthy food” or “plant” becoming less recurring. This analysis also expresses the importance that social media have nowadays on these topics and are deeply analyzed by the speakers.
